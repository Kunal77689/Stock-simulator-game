## Description

### NAME : ProfitLogic Trader: Buy, Sell, Prosper

### User Perpective

I am pleased to present my Stock Exchange Simulator Game, a cutting-edge, approachable platform for virtual trading activities. This instructive game simulates the dynamics of a real stock exchange and lets users experiment with different investment strategies in a risk-free environment. The simulator offers a realistic and interactive environment for developing and improving portfolios, understanding market trends, and improving financial literacyâ€”regardless of experience level. The game is a great platform for anyone who wants to confidently navigate the complexity of the stock market because it's both entertaining and informative. Users interact with the application by making HTTP requests to the backend server through REST API calls.

### Admin Perpective

The Stock Exchange Simulator Game uses MongoDB for safe data storage from an administrative perspective. Administrators can easily keep an eye on virtual trading activity thanks to the GUI's streamlining of user profile administration. Real-time insights into user performance, investment trends, and transaction history are available through the admin window. Every buy/sell transaction is recorded for prompt analysis, guaranteeing effective supervision and improving the customer experience as a whole.

**Picture1:**
Here in the first picture, it shows the user's perspective. It is displaying the portfolio page which consists of Overwiew(user's account value, cash), Game stats(tells about the current ranking and the top payer) and performance(Show user profile trends over 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months for a comprehensive performance overview) columns. On the bottom is the list of holdings which the user have.

**Picture2:**
Similarly, the user can click on the trade right next to portfolio and it will go to the trades page which is shown by picture 2. Here, the first field is a search box where the user can select the desired stock of their choice. There are fields like Buy/Sell from where you can choose the appropriate choice, Quantity, Order Type, Duration. At the end there are two buttons, one for clear
and the other one Confirm Selection(when clicked, a dialog box will appear which will ask the user: You are about to make a trade of "amount", are you sure you want to proceed?)
I have added a calculator so that the user can do any calculations without opening any external app before making the trade.

**Picture3:**
When selected yes, the trade will be available under the order status. When clicked on Order Status, it will look like picture 3. Here, the page is divided in two half, the first half shows the trades which are either made successfully or which are in progress. The bottom half shows the trades which were failed/cancelled.

**Picture4:**
It shows the admin view where the admin can see a bunch of users of the game under the portfolio section. The admin can delete/add user from this page. If clicked on individual user, the admin can see the properties of an individual user. The admin can see user's stocks, performance, account balance. The admin has the access to create new game, modify the previously created games or make any user an admin.

**Picture 5:**
This snapshot displays a list of games from which users can choose, register, and play with different users.

**Picture 6:**
This view presents a list of users sorted by their account value, indicating which user has the most money and vice versa.

**Picture 7:**
In this view, users can see a list of games in which they have already registered.
